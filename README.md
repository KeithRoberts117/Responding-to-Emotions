This is a research project in collaboration with Andrew Leal. 

TL;DR -- This research will investigate the impact that varying emotional tones in messaging have on decision makers in a laboratory setting when financial/ monetary requests are made.

A consequence of being human is that, whether conscious or not, emotions are inextricably linked to decision-making. Theoretical and empirical work in decision theory and psychological game theory has explored several channels through which emotions can impact an individualâ€™s decision process. This large and growing body of research has focused almost exclusively on the emotions felt by the decision maker. In contrast, we seek to study how the emotional content of a message received by a decision maker impacts their choices and the degree to which differences can be attributed to emotional contagion. 

Embedding requests with emotional content is common in practice. Charities tend to use collaborative messaging with undertones of sadness and pleading. Politicians often use a mix of collaborative and competitive messaging when campaigning or promoting policies, and incite action by delivering such messages with emotional tones, sometimes chosen strategically. For example, in 2008, CEO of Maple Leaf Foods Michael McCain issued an apology for health standard failures that lead to listeriosis outbreaks causing 23 deaths and approximately 4,000 illnesses. Despite this failure, customers remained loyal to Maple Leaf Foods, with credit often going to the sincerity of the apology and the personal accountability expressed therein. 

A natural question arising from this example is thus: Would the same message delivered in a neutral or angry tone have had a similar impact?
