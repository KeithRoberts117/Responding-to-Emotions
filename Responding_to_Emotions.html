<h1>Responding to Emotions: Effects of Emotional Tone on Decision-Making</h1>
<section id="emotional-tone-in-communication-and-decision-making" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="emotional-tone-in-communication-and-decision-making">1. Emotional Tone in Communication and Decision-Making</h2>
<p>Emotional tone – the affective content or sentiment conveyed by language, facial expression, or voice – can significantly shape how recipients make decisions. Unlike a communicator’s internal feelings, emotional tone refers to the outward expression (e.g.&nbsp;angry vs.&nbsp;calm language) that others perceive. Research in behavioral economics and psychology shows that such emotional cues embedded in messages influence trust, generosity, and strategic choices by the recipient. For example, in negotiation settings, <strong>expressing anger often compels counterparts to concede more</strong>, whereas displaying happiness can lead to smaller concessions. This suggests that an emotionally “negative” tone can signal toughness or urgency, altering the other party’s behavior. In a classic experiment, proposers in an ultimatum game offered more generous splits when facing a <em>happy</em> responder and the least when facing an <em>angry</em> or <em>disgusted</em> responder. Similarly, in trust games, <strong>partners with happy facial expressions elicit higher trust (larger investments) than those with angry expressions</strong>, who receive less investment. Emotional tone in communication also plays a role in financial and policy domains. A recent study of U.S. Federal Reserve press conferences found that <strong>Chair Jerome Powell’s negative emotional tone (as detected in his voice)</strong> moved equity markets by a magnitude comparable to a substantive policy change – even when the transcript content remained constant. This underscores that beyond logical content, the sentiment or tone of a message can independently sway economic decisions. In short, a growing literature demonstrates that <em>how</em> something is communicated emotionally can shape the recipient’s decisions on giving, trading, or cooperating, independent of <em>what</em> is being said. Psychology studies on persuasion mirror these findings: for instance, strong fear-based messages reliably produce greater attitude and behavior change than neutral ones by heightening perceived risk and urgency (as shown in meta-analyses of fear appeals). Overall, emotional tone serves as a social signal and catalyst in decision-making – whether by evoking empathy, threat, or confidence – and recent economics experiments are increasingly factoring in these emotional dynamics alongside traditional incentives.</p>

<section id="emotional-contagion-in-economic-decision-making" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="emotional-contagion-in-economic-decision-making">2. Emotional Contagion in Economic Decision-Making</h2>
<p>Emotional contagion refers to the phenomenon where one person’s emotions spread to others, causing recipients to “catch” the same feelings. In decision-making contexts, emotional contagion can occur when the mood of one individual (or a piece of content) influences the emotional state and subsequent choices of another, <em>distinct</em> from any direct informational effect of the communication. The <strong>Emotions as Social Information (EASI)</strong> model formalizes this distinction: an observer may either consciously infer information from another’s emotion (a strategic/cognitive route) or unconsciously mimic and feel that emotion themselves (an affective route). The latter route is contagion. Empirical studies have demonstrated emotional contagion in both lab and field settings. A striking example is the massive-scale <strong>Facebook experiment</strong> by Kramer et al.&nbsp;(2014), which showed that altering the emotional content of users’ news feeds influenced their own posting behavior. When positive posts were reduced, users’ status updates became more negative, and when negative content was reduced, users produced more positive language. Notably, participants were unaware of the manipulation, so the changes in their behavior reflect <em>contagion</em> of mood rather than a conscious response to message framing. The study concluded that “emotions expressed via online social networks influence the moods of others”, providing clear evidence of contagion at scale. In laboratory games, contagion has also been observed. For instance, in a public goods experiment where groups watched emotional videos, inducing fear, disgust, or happiness in one member tended to lower everyone’s subsequent cooperation compared to a neutral condition – as if one person’s emotional state “infected” the group’s mood and trust level. Classic organizational research by Barsade (2002) found that <strong>groups with a happy confederate had improved cooperation and less conflict</strong>, indicating that one person’s positive emotion can ripple through others to impact collective decisions. To <strong>identify contagion effects apart from direct framing</strong>, researchers often use design features like emotion induction that is <em>incidental</em> to the decision task or measure participants’ mood changes. For example, one study varied traders’ moods via background music and found mood contagion influenced asset prices even though the music carried no financial information. Another approach is exploiting natural exogenous mood shocks: economists have linked rainy weather or sports team losses to negative investor sentiment and market moves, attributing this to incidental mood carryover rather than news – effectively emotional contagion influencing economic behavior. In summary, emotional contagion is a documented mechanism in economic settings: people unwittingly absorb and mirror others’ emotions, which in turn can alter their risk-taking, generosity, or strategic choices. This contagion mechanism is conceptually distinct from emotional framing effects where a message’s tone directly persuades; instead, <strong>contagion operates by changing the recipient’s internal state</strong>, which then affects decisions. Modern experiments and data analysis methods (e.g.&nbsp;sentiment analysis, psychophysiology) allow researchers to isolate this pathway by controlling for informational content and observing mood-mediated changes in behavior.</p>

<section id="interactions-of-emotional-tone-and-message-framing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interactions-of-emotional-tone-and-message-framing">3. Interactions of Emotional Tone and Message Framing</h2>
<p>Some studies have explicitly crossed emotional tone with message framing to examine their interaction. For example, communications can be framed in different ways (gain vs.&nbsp;loss, cooperative vs.&nbsp;competitive) <em>and</em> delivered with different emotional tones (positive, negative, angry, etc.). <strong>Health messaging research</strong> provides a clear illustration: Gerend and Maner (2011) randomly induced participants to feel fear or anger and then exposed them to either a gain-framed or loss-framed health brochure. They found a significant interaction: fearful participants responded best to loss-framed messages (leading to greater fruit &amp; vegetable intake), whereas angry participants were more persuaded by gain-framed messages. In other words, a <em>mismatched</em> tone/frame (e.g.&nbsp;an angry person hearing a loss frame) was less effective than a matched one. This suggests emotional tone can modulate how framing effects play out, likely because emotions like fear and anger differ in motivation (avoidance vs.&nbsp;approach) and attention, which interact with the message’s focus on costs or benefits.</p>
<p>In economic or strategic contexts, researchers have looked at emotional tone together with situational framing such as competitive vs.&nbsp;collaborative settings. <strong>Negotiation experiments</strong> show that the impact of an emotional tone (e.g.&nbsp;anger) depends on the interpersonal frame. When a context is overtly competitive or one-shot (e.g.&nbsp;splitting a fixed pie), an angry tone by one party often yields advantage – the counterpart concedes more, interpreting the anger as a sign of toughness or high demands. However, in a more collaborative or repeat-interaction frame, the same anger can backfire by eroding trust and reducing joint outcomes. Van Dijk et al.&nbsp;(2008) observed that expressing anger in an integrative negotiation (where parties can find win-win outcomes) decreased cooperation and hindered agreements, whereas in a purely distributive negotiation, anger secured better individual deals for the expresser. Thus, <strong>emotional tone and message framing can interact</strong>: an emotional display might be effective under one frame but detrimental under another. Another study varied whether an angry message was directed at the <em>issue</em> (e.g.&nbsp;“this offer makes me angry”) or at the <em>person</em> in an ultimatum game; anger at the offer led responders to infer a tough stance and increase offers, but anger directed personally did <em>not</em> increase concessions. This indicates researchers operationalize emotional tone in nuanced ways – via scripted language, tone of voice, or facial expressions – and measure its effect across different message framings. Emotional tone is typically <strong>operationalized by pre-testing communications</strong> (e.g.&nbsp;writing request messages that are identical except for emotionally charged words or punctuation), by using trained actors/confederates to deliver messages with a certain emotional demeanor, or by showing images/videos of communicators with particular expressions. The tone manipulation is often verified by asking participants to rate the emotionality or by physiological measures. For example, a study on collaboration vs.&nbsp;competition had leaders send team messages either with a supportive, warm tone or a cold, critical tone, crossed with a message framing emphasizing either team unity (collaboration frame) or individual achievement (competition frame). Emotional tone was confirmed via participants’ perception ratings. Such factorial experiments allow researchers to see if an emotional tone has an additive effect or an interactive effect with how the message is framed. Overall, the literature finds <strong>non-trivial interactions</strong>: emotional tone can amplify or dampen framing effects. A positive, encouraging tone might boost the effectiveness of a collaborative frame (people reciprocate warmth with cooperation), whereas a negative tone might undermine it. Conversely, in competitive or high-stakes frames, a mild emotional tone may be overlooked, but a strong negative tone might “set the stage” that the issue is serious, affecting outcomes. While relatively few economics papers have full 2x2 designs of tone and framing, related work in psychology and organizational behavior provides evidence that both factors jointly influence decisions. The key takeaway is that emotional tone <em>does not operate in isolation</em> – its impact often depends on context and framing. Researchers measure this by outcome differences and occasionally by interaction terms in statistical analysis (e.g.&nbsp;regression showing a significant tone×frame interaction on the decision variable). The nuanced findings underscore why emotional factors must be incorporated carefully in experiment design: different emotional tones can flip the script on classic framing effects, and vice versa.</p>

<section id="measuring-emotional-responses-in-experiments" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="measuring-emotional-responses-in-experiments">4. Measuring Emotional Responses in Experiments</h2>
<p>Accurately measuring participants’ emotional states in response to stimuli is crucial for studying causal effects of emotion. Researchers have developed <strong>multiple tools and methodologies</strong> – each with advantages – to capture emotional responses to video/audio stimuli in lab and field experiments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Self-Report Measures:</strong> The simplest and most direct method is asking participants how they feel. Standardized questionnaires like the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) or visual analog scales allow subjects to rate their emotional state (e.g.&nbsp;mood, arousal) after exposure to a stimulus. Self-reports can capture the subjective feeling component of emotion. They are easy to implement (surveys during or after experiments) and can distinguish discrete emotions (asking, for instance, “How angry do you feel?” on a scale). Studies often use self-reports as manipulation checks – e.g.&nbsp;confirming that a scary video indeed raised fear levels. Evidence suggests <strong>contemporaneous self-reports are reasonably valid</strong> if collected immediately. For example, Mauss and Robinson (2009) note that real-time self-reports of current emotion correlate well with physiological and behavioral indicators, whereas retrospective reports are less reliable. Thus, many experiments include immediate emotion surveys. In a public goods game experiment with induced emotions, researchers might ask participants to rate their current stress, happiness, etc., after the stimulus; these self-ratings help link emotional state to subsequent decisions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Facial Expression Analysis:</strong> Emotions often manifest in facial expressions, and researchers leverage this through either manual coding or automated facial recognition. A well-known system is the <strong>Facial Action Coding System (FACS)</strong>, which trained coders use to identify muscle movements (Action Units) corresponding to emotions (e.g.&nbsp;AU12 – lip corner raise – for smiling/happiness). In recent years, automated <strong>facial recognition software</strong> (e.g.&nbsp;Noldus FaceReader, Affectiva Affdex) has enabled real-time emotion detection via webcam. These algorithms analyze facial muscle movements frame-by-frame and classify expressions into basic emotions (happiness, anger, sadness, etc.) with an intensity score. For instance, one study used FaceReader to measure participants’ reactions to health PSAs: the software output how much “fear” vs “disgust” each viewer’s face showed, which predicted message effectiveness. Validation research finds that such software can achieve good accuracy. In one comparison, Affectiva’s automated coding correlated highly with facial EMG (electromyography) readings and correctly identified posed happy and angry faces above chance. Automated facial coding has been used in lab experiments – for example, to measure subtle emotional responses during ultimatum games or to detect smiling vs.&nbsp;frowning while participants watch negotiation videos. These tools provide continuous, objective data on emotional expression without interrupting the task. A caution is that they infer emotion from expression, which works best for strong, prototypical expressions; some emotions (e.g.&nbsp;moral elevation or subtle anxiety) are harder to capture. Nonetheless, facial analysis is a powerful methodology to observe <em>in-the-moment</em> emotional reactions, especially when paired with video stimuli.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Physiological and Neurological Measures:</strong> Emotions induce physiological changes – something lab experiments exploit via sensors. Common measures include <strong>skin conductance</strong> (sweat gland activity indicating arousal), <strong>heart rate or heart rate variability</strong>, blood pressure, and <strong>pupil dilation</strong>. For example, a fearful response to a stimulus often elevates skin conductance and heart rate. These can be recorded with biofeedback devices to quantify emotional arousal. Similarly, facial EMG involves placing electrodes on muscle groups like the corrugator supercilii (brow muscle) and zygomaticus major (cheek muscle) to detect micro-expressions of frowning or smiling. EMG provides a very sensitive measure of valence: greater corrugator activation reliably signals negative affect (frown) while zygomatic activation signals positive affect (smile). For instance, in a bargaining experiment, increased frowning EMG when receiving a low offer would indicate emotional irritation, which might predict rejection. Some experiments also use <strong>hormonal assays</strong> (cortisol for stress, oxytocin for affection) or even <strong>fMRI/EEG</strong> to see neural correlates of emotional processing. While these measures are more intrusive or costly, they offer objective evidence of an emotional state that complements self-report. A notable deployment in economics was a study where subjects’ skin conductance was recorded as they evaluated risky gambles; spikes in conductance (emotional arousal) preceded risk-averse choices, suggesting an emotional basis for the decision.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sentiment and Text/Voice Analysis:</strong> In field experiments or analyses of real-world communications, researchers use computational linguistics to gauge emotional tone. <strong>Sentiment analysis</strong> involves analyzing text (or transcripts of speech) for emotional content – for example, counting positive vs.&nbsp;negative words, or using machine learning classifiers trained to detect tone (angry, fearful, reassuring, etc.). This approach has been applied to <strong>political speeches, social media posts, and news</strong>. An illustrative case is the analysis of Fed chairs’ speech transcripts versus vocal tone: content analysis of transcripts can control for the rational information, while <strong>voice emotion analysis</strong> (using AI to classify audio into emotions like happy, sad, angry) captures the tonal sentiment. In the 2021 Fed study, researchers did exactly this – using ML on audio recordings to assign an emotional score to each press conference, independent of the words spoken. In other contexts, experiments that allow free-form communication (e.g.&nbsp;chat messages in a multiplayer game) have used sentiment analysis to quantify the emotional tone of messages participants send each other, then linked that to cooperation levels. <strong>Natural language processing (NLP)</strong> tools like LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) provide dictionaries of emotion-laden words (e.g.&nbsp;“love,” “terrified”) to quantify how emotional a piece of text is. Similarly, for spoken stimuli, tone of voice features (pitch, volume variation) can be analyzed – high pitch and loudness might indicate excitement or anger. These techniques are especially useful in field studies or online experiments with large text data. For example, one field study of fundraising emails used sentiment analysis to show that <strong>expressed positive emotion in the appeal was associated with higher donation rates</strong>. In summary, sentiment analysis allows researchers to both <em>manipulate</em> and <em>measure</em> emotional tone in communications at scale, providing a bridge between qualitative emotional content and quantitative data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers often combine methods for robustness. A lab experiment might use video stimuli and capture facial expressions via webcam, ask participants to self-report feelings after, and possibly record physiological arousal during the video. Convergence of evidence (e.g.&nbsp;a participant’s face shows a frown, high skin conductance, and self-reported anger) gives confidence that the emotional state is real and intense. New technologies (wearables, face/voice APIs, even infrared facial temperature sensing for stress) are expanding the toolkit for emotion measurement. Importantly, ethical and privacy considerations are kept in mind, especially for implicit measures: participants are usually informed if video or biosignals are recorded, and analyses aggregate data to ensure anonymity of emotional responses. With these tools, experimenters can quantitatively track how emotional stimuli impact participants, enabling stronger tests of causal links between induced emotions and decision outcomes.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="identification-of-causal-effects-of-emotional-framing-on-economic-behaviors">5. Identification of Causal Effects of Emotional Framing on Economic Behaviors</h2>
<p>Laboratory experiments are carefully designed to <strong>identify causal effects</strong> of emotional framing or tone on behaviors such as giving, voting, or cooperation. The gold standard is <strong>randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs</strong>, wherein participants are randomly assigned to different emotional framing conditions. By holding all else equal and only varying the emotional content or tone of a request, any systematic differences in outcomes can be attributed to that emotional framing. For example, an experiment on charitable giving might prepare two versions of a donation request: one written in a neutral, factual tone and one in an emotionally evocative tone (say, describing a beneficiary’s plight in heart-tugging language). These messages would be randomly distributed to participants. If the emotional appeal yields higher donations on average, the randomization ensures this difference is a causal effect of the emotional framing. Indeed, field experiments by fundraisers employ this method: one study found that a story about a single suffering child (emotional frame) prompted <strong>significantly more donations than a statistical facts frame</strong>, isolating the identifiable victim effect as a causal influence.</p>
<p>Common identification strategies in lab/field experiments include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Between-Subjects Designs:</strong> Participants are split into groups, each exposed to a different emotional tone or frame. Because of random assignment, personal characteristics balance out across groups. For instance, in a voting experiment, one group sees a political ad delivered in an angry tone, another sees the same ad delivered calmly. Any difference in voting intention between groups can be causally linked to tone. Researchers often confirm that the only systematic difference between conditions is the intended manipulation (through manipulation checks of perceived tone, etc.). By avoiding any overlap in exposure, between-subjects designs also prevent emotional spillovers between conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Within-Subject Controls:</strong> Sometimes researchers use a within-subject design (though less common for emotions due to carryover). For example, each participant might make decisions before and after an emotional stimulus, effectively using each person as their own control. If generosity increases after an empathy-inducing video, one can infer the video caused the change. However, to avoid confounding factors like learning or fatigue, within-subject emotion inductions are used sparingly or counter-balanced in order.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Standardized Emotional Stimuli:</strong> A key to causal identification is delivering a consistent treatment. Experiments often use validated emotional stimuli – e.g.&nbsp;a set of images or film clips known from prior research to reliably induce a target emotion (fear, disgust, sadness). By using standardized stimuli (from databases like the IAPS images or film libraries), researchers ensure that each participant in the “emotion” condition experiences a similar dose of emotion. The control group might see a neutral video. Nguyen &amp; Noussair (2022), for instance, induced fear, happiness, or disgust in subjects via brief 360° videos before a public goods game. The videos were pre-tested to evoke those emotions, and because subjects were randomly assigned to which video they saw, the subsequent differences in contributions could be causally attributed to the induced emotion (fear, happiness, etc. vs.&nbsp;neutral).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Manipulation Checks and Exclusion:</strong> To strengthen causal claims, experiments include checks that the emotional manipulation “took hold.” If a participant in a fear condition doesn’t actually report feeling any fear, researchers might exclude such cases or analyze separately, as the treatment wasn’t received as intended. Causal inference is clearest when participants in the emotion condition indeed felt differently than those in the control. Additionally, experiments often keep participants and even experimenters blind to the hypothesis to avoid demand effects (e.g.&nbsp;subjects shouldn’t guess “they want me to donate more because of this sad story”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isolation of Emotion vs.&nbsp;Information:</strong> A sophisticated identification strategy is to vary emotional tone <strong>without changing informational content</strong>. This can be done by creating messages that are identical in facts but differ in tone (using emotionally charged adjectives, imagery, or vocal cues). The <strong>Powell Fed study</strong> is a great example: researchers held constant the substantive policy content (by controlling for the text of statements) and isolated the emotional tone in voice. They showed the tone had an effect on markets independent of any new information. In the lab, a charity experiment might use the same script about a cause but record two versions – one read in a trembling, emotional voice and one in a flat, clinical voice – to see how tone alone affects donations. By ensuring participants across conditions receive the <em>same underlying message</em> except for emotional delivery, any outcome differences reflect the causal impact of emotional framing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Instrumental Variables / Natural Experiments:</strong> While less common in lab settings (since randomization is feasible), some field studies use instrumental variable approaches to identify emotional effects. For example, researchers have used rainfall as an instrument for mood to study stock trading behavior: rain randomly induces bad mood (emotion) which in turn affects risk-taking, with rain itself unrelated to fundamentals. Such designs aim to establish causality by finding random variation in emotion that is not confounded by other factors. Another natural experiment approach was used in a Facebook study where timing of content changes was randomized by the platform, acting as an instrument for exposure to certain emotional content.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In laboratory economic games, scholars have also induced emotions incidentally (unrelated to the game’s context) to test for carryover effects. For example, Andrade and Ariely (2009) had subjects watch an emotional movie clip and then play an ultimatum game. The random assignment of clips allowed them to conclude that <em>incidental anger</em> made responders more likely to reject offers – a causal link between emotion and economic decision. <strong>Panel data or repeated measures</strong> can further bolster causality: if the same subject is exposed to different emotional tones over rounds and changes behavior mainly in emotional rounds, within-subject analysis can pin down the emotional impact while differencing out individual baseline differences.</p>
<p>To identify causal <strong>direction</strong>, experiments also carefully time the emotional manipulation before the decision. This sequencing (emotion induction → decision) helps rule out reverse causality (the decision influencing emotion). Some lab studies use physiological measurements in real time to confirm that an emotional spike occurs <em>prior</em> to the decision change. For example, increased heart rate or frowning right after seeing a message, and then an immediate decision shift, suggests the emotion caused the behavior.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>field experiments</strong> in fundraising and political campaigns have embraced A/B testing to causally identify emotional appeal effects. In one field study, DellaVigna et al.&nbsp;(2012) sent out charitable solicitation letters where some households received a strongly emotional appeal and others a neutral one, or in some cases an option to opt-out to avoid emotional “pressure.” The randomization showed that many people gave mainly due to empathy/guilt from the emotional ask – and some would even pay a small cost to avoid encountering the fundraiser, indicating a causal role of emotional pressure. This kind of evidence, combined with lab replications, solidifies the conclusion that emotional framing has a direct causal impact on economic decisions, not merely correlation.</p>
<p>In summary, peer-reviewed experiments achieve identification through random assignment, careful stimulus design, content controls, and checks on the emotional states induced. The most common and convincing strategy is a randomized experiment varying only emotional tone, thereby attributing differences in giving, voting, or cooperation to that tone with high internal validity. When well-implemented, such designs allow researchers to make strong causal statements – for instance, “Using a sympathetic narrative <em>causes</em> higher donations, relative to a factual appeal,” or “An angry tone by a leader <em>causes</em> team members to reduce their cooperative effort.” Each study contributes pieces to the puzzle, and collectively they give confidence in the causal linkages between emotional communications and economic behavior.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="literature-review-outline-emotional-tone-of-requests-and-decision-making">6. Literature Review Outline: Emotional Tone of Requests and Decision-Making</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Theoretical Frameworks and Models</strong>: Begin by outlining theories that explain <em>why</em> emotional tone affects decisions. This includes economic and psychological models integrating emotion into choice. For example, the <strong>Emotion-as-Information</strong> theory (Schwarz &amp; Clore, 1983) posits that people use feelings as heuristics in judgment. The <strong>Interpersonal Effects of Emotion</strong> in games are formalized by Van&nbsp;Kleef’s EASI model (2010), which delineates informative vs.&nbsp;affective pathways by which one person’s emotional expression alters another’s behavior. Also mention decision-theoretic models like <strong>risk-as-feelings</strong> (Loewenstein et al., 2001) and <strong>dual-process models</strong> (emotion vs.&nbsp;reason) in behavioral economics. Key citations: Lerner et al.&nbsp;(2015) on emotion’s role in decision-making, Van&nbsp;Kleef (2010) on EASI, Rick &amp; Loewenstein (2008) on emotion in economic behavior, Elster (1998) on integrating emotions into economic theory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Emotional Contagion and Social Influence</strong>: Review literature on how one person’s emotion can spread to others and influence decisions. Include <strong>psychology findings on emotional contagion</strong> (Hatfield, Cacioppo &amp; Rapson, 1993) and highlight economics/finance examples of collective emotion. For instance, Barsade (2002) demonstrates group contagion in a cooperative task (positive mood improving group performance). Kramer et al.&nbsp;(2014) provide experimental evidence of <strong>contagion in online networks</strong>. Also discuss field evidence like <strong>sentiment contagion in markets</strong> (e.g.&nbsp;investor optimism/pessimism spreading and leading to herding behavior). Distinguish contagion effects from direct framing – e.g.&nbsp;<strong>Coviello et al.&nbsp;(2014)</strong> using weather as an instrument for Facebook users’ mood found friends’ emotions shift accordingly, indicating a contagion mechanism. This section solidifies that beyond deliberate emotional appeals, incidental emotions propagate and <em>cause</em> changes in economic behavior (e.g.&nbsp;mood-linked variation in risk-taking or spending).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Experimental Methodologies</strong>: Group studies by how they experimentally manipulate and measure emotional tone. Discuss <strong>laboratory designs</strong> that vary emotional content in requests: e.g.&nbsp;<em>Scharlemann et al.&nbsp;(2001)</em> – an experiment showing a smiling requester in a trust game increases trust investments. Describe methodologies such as using <strong>scripted emotional scripts or facial expressions</strong> (Ferracci et al., 2022, who used images of happy/angry faces in an ultimatum game) and <strong>incidental emotion inductions</strong> (e.g.&nbsp;Andrade &amp; Ho, 2009 – inducing anger before negotiations). Include <strong>field experiment techniques</strong>: DellaVigna et al.&nbsp;(2012) in fundraising, who randomized emotionally charged solicitation letters to identify causal effects of empathy/guilt on giving. Also note measurement methods as part of methodology: some studies pair the manipulation with <strong>physiological or observational measures</strong> (e.g.&nbsp;measuring recipients’ heart rate or facial reactions to confirm emotional impact). This grouping emphasizes <em>how</em> researchers bring emotion into an experimental economics setting – through design and instrumentation. Key examples: <strong>Gerend &amp; Maner (2011)</strong> – 2×2 design crossing emotional state (fear vs.&nbsp;anger) with message frame; <strong>Sinaceur &amp; Tiedens (2006)</strong> – varying expressed anger in a negotiation and measuring concessions; <strong>Zhou et al.&nbsp;(2023)</strong> – repeated trust game with partners displaying happy vs.&nbsp;angry faces, measuring trust decisions. Discuss each study’s design and findings briefly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Differential Impacts and Mechanisms (Emotional Tone vs.&nbsp;Content)</strong>: Group literature that disentangles why emotional tone matters – is it changing preferences, beliefs, or the inference of intentions? Include <strong>theoretical pieces</strong> like Hilton (2008) on emotional undertones in risk communication influencing behavior by <em>pragmatic signals</em>. Empirical papers in this group might examine <em>mechanisms</em>: e.g.&nbsp;Pietroni et al.&nbsp;(2008) finding that a proposer’s happy expression made responders infer the proposer had a strong outside option, thus responders accepted low offers (here tone affected beliefs about the game). Another example: Lerner &amp; Keltner (2001) showed anger vs.&nbsp;fear lead to different risk perceptions (emotion influencing expectations). This section can also cover <strong>framing interactions</strong>: how emotional tone might reinforce or counteract classic framing effects (Tannenbaum et al., 2015 meta-analysis of fear appeals demonstrates that including high emotional content generally boosts persuasion outcomes). By clustering these works, the outline will highlight the nuanced <em>why</em> and <em>when</em> emotional tone changes decisions – through altering risk estimates, empathy levels, or norm perceptions – beyond just noting that it does.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Application Domains</strong>: Finally, organize studies by specific domains where emotional tone of requests has been studied, to show breadth of impact. Possible subgroups:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Charitable Giving and Altruism</em>: Emotional appeals in fundraising (Small et al., 2007 – identifiable victim effect causing “heartstrings” to outweigh statistics; Cryder &amp; Loewenstein, 2012 on sympathy; Bettman et al., 2020 on social media charity campaigns with emotional content). Findings: personal, emotional narratives increase donations; guilt or empathy can be leveraged but can also lead to avoidance behavior if overdone.</li>
<li><em>Political Participation and Voting</em>: Emotional tone in political messaging (Brader, 2005 – enthusiasm vs.&nbsp;fear appeals in campaign ads affecting turnout; Valentino et al., 2011 – anger appeals polarizing attitudes). Key results: <strong>enthusiastic tones mobilize base voters</strong>, fear can persuade via increased information seeking, and anger in partisan messages can boost engagement but also reduce willingness to consider opposing viewpoints.</li>
<li><em>Negotiation and Conflict Resolution</em>: Emotional tactics in bargaining (Van&nbsp;Kleef et al., 2004 – anger leads to larger concessions in one-shot bargaining; Butt et al., 2005 – disappointment or sadness expressions induce empathy and fairer offers). Also in labor or diplomatic negotiations: expressing emotions strategically to influence perceived bargaining power.</li>
<li><em>Consumer and Market Behavior</em>: How emotional content in communication influences economic choices in markets. This includes advertising (positive emotional appeals enhancing brand perception and purchase intention), <strong>financial communications</strong> (Kamstra et al., 2003 – seasonal affect influencing stock returns; the Gorodnichenko et al., 2021 result that a central bank’s emotional tone moves markets). Also mention experiments on <strong>asset markets</strong> where investor sentiment (optimism/pessimism) is manipulated or measured, showing effects on price bubbles or volatility.</li>
<li><em>Public Goods and Cooperation</em>: Studies on appeals for cooperation or prosocial behavior with varying tone. For example, public health messages (COVID-19 distancing appeals delivered in empathetic vs.&nbsp;authoritative tone and their effects on compliance), or environmental campaigns (climate change appeals that use fear vs.&nbsp;hope). Include any lab public goods game findings: if leaders/emissaries in a group can send messages, a supportive emotional tone tends to sustain cooperation, whereas a scolding tone may undermine it (e.g.&nbsp;Masclet et al., 2003 on emotional feedback in punishment).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Within each domain, list representative papers (authors, year) and their main finding about emotional tone. This domain-based grouping will show that the influence of emotional tone is robust across very different contexts – from one-on-one asks (donations, bargaining) to mass communication (political or financial rhetoric). It also helps identify any gaps: e.g.&nbsp;plenty on charity and negotiation, perhaps less in worker performance or B2B communications – which could be highlighted as a research gap if relevant.</p>
<p>Each group in the outline should include key citations (with year) that anchor the literature. For instance: <strong>“Striking a Responsive Chord” (Brader 2005)</strong> under politics, <strong>“Get Mad and Get More” (Sinaceur &amp; Tiedens 2006)</strong> under negotiation, <strong>“Identifiable victim effect” (Small et al.&nbsp;2007)</strong> under charity, etc., as well as any notable theoretical pieces like <strong>“Emotions as Social Information” (Van&nbsp;Kleef 2010)</strong> under theory. This structured overview sets the stage for a study on emotional tone of requests by covering foundational theory, contagion aspects, experimental methods, and findings across applications.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-articles-by-category">7. Key Articles by Category</h2>
<p><strong>1) Motivation and Research Gap</strong> – foundational works highlighting why studying emotional tone in economics is important and where the research gap lies:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Lerner, J. S., Li, Y., Valdesolo, P., &amp; Kassam, K. S. (2015).</strong> <em>“Emotion and Decision Making.”</em> <strong>Annual Review of Psychology, 66</strong>, 799-823. – <em>Comprehensive review</em> of decades of research integrating emotion into decision-making. Summarizes how emotions (incidental and integral) systematically influence judgments and choices, often in ways classical theories didn’t predict. This article motivates the research by showing that while psychology has documented these effects, economics models are only recently incorporating emotion. It identifies gaps such as the need to study specific emotions (anger, fear, etc.) in social and economic decisions, and calls for more research on interpersonal emotion effects. (Peer-reviewed, high-level synthesis.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Van Kleef, G. A. (2010).</strong> <em>“The Emerging View of Emotion as Social Information.”</em> <strong>Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 4(5)</strong>, 331-343. – Theoretical piece introducing the Emotions as Social Information (EASI) model. Argues that others’ emotional expressions inform observers’ decisions by two pathways – inferential (strategic reasoning) and affective (emotional contagion). Highlights a research gap: most decision-making studies focused on a person’s own emotions (intrapersonal), whereas the <em>interpersonal</em> power of communicated emotions (emotional tone between people) was under-studied. This paper motivates research into how a sender’s emotional tone can strategically shape a receiver’s behavior (important for negotiations, leadership, etc.). It’s frequently cited to justify examining emotional tone in interactive economic contexts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Elster, J. (1998).</strong> <em>“Emotions and Economic Theory.”</em> <strong>Journal of Economic Literature, 36(1)</strong>, 47-74. – A foundational essay by economist Jon Elster that critiques the absence of emotions in economic theory. While a bit older, it articulates the importance of emotions (like anger, empathy, guilt) in real economic behavior – motivations that standard models often treat as “anomalies.” Elster identifies specific gaps: for instance, economic theories of bargaining didn’t account for anger leading to costly rejections, and public finance models ignored sympathy driving charity. This piece motivates the integration of emotional factors and essentially sets an agenda that phenomena like emotional tone in communication <em>should</em> be studied to better predict economic outcomes. It provides intellectual justification that the project “Responding to Emotions” addresses a known gap in traditional theory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rick, S. &amp; Loewenstein, G. (2008).</strong> <em>“The Role of Emotion in Economic Behavior.”</em> In M. Lewis &amp; J. Haviland-Jones (Eds.), <strong>Handbook of Emotions (3rd ed.)</strong> – A chapter (peer-reviewed in edited volume) that surveys how immediate emotions impact behaviors like saving, gambling, and bargaining. It emphasizes that emotions are not just noise but can systematically alter time preferences, risk-taking, and social exchange. The authors point out that while psychology had many lab demonstrations, economics at that time had relatively few formal models or experiments capturing these effects. They highlight research gaps such as the need to study <strong>emotional carryover</strong> (how an emotion from one context affects another decision) and <strong>interpersonal emotion</strong> (how one person’s emotions influence another’s choices). This work helps motivate our project by showing that “emotional tone of a request” lies at the intersection of those gaps – it’s an emotional carryover transmitted interpersonally.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hilton, D. (2008).</strong> <em>“Emotional Tone and Argumentation in Risk Communication.”</em> <strong>Journal of Judgment and Decision Making, 3(1)</strong>, 100-110. – Denis Hilton’s article (peer-reviewed) discusses how human communication about risks is imbued with emotional undertones that can encourage or discourage actions. It contrasts “constative” content with “performative” emotional tone. The paper argues that classical models of rational communication overlook how <strong>emotional framing</strong> (positive vs.&nbsp;negative tone) can shift the listener’s focus and behavior. It provides mini-reviews of studies where logically identical messages with different emotional wording led to different decisions – thus explicitly highlighting the importance of <em>tone</em>. Hilton calls for more research into these pragmatic, emotional aspects of communication, essentially marking a gap between how people <em>actually</em> decide under risk (influenced by tone) and how models assume they decide (by content only). This serves as a direct intellectual motivation for studying emotional tone effects in economic decision contexts like our project.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2) Emotional Contagion</strong> – key articles demonstrating emotional contagion and its effects on decision-making, distinguishing it from direct framing:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Kramer, A. D. I., Guillory, J. E., &amp; Hancock, J. T. (2014).</strong> <em>“Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks.”</em> <strong>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 111(24)</strong>, 8788-8790. – Famous study on Facebook’s news feed experiment. By randomly reducing positive or negative posts seen by ~689,000 users, the authors showed that users’ own posting behavior became more negative or positive correspondingly. Importantly, this occurred <em>without</em> direct interaction or explicit emotional appeals – evidence of pure contagion. This article is central in proving that emotions can spread in large networks and influence expressed behaviors (like word choice) <em>causally</em>. It also carefully notes that the effect was not due to concurrent changes in content relevance, isolating emotion contagion. This study is a cornerstone for the concept that one person’s emotional tone can “infect” others’ moods and thereby their decisions, even in an economic context (e.g.&nbsp;consumer sentiment on networks).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Barsade, S. G. (2002).</strong> <em>“The Ripple Effect: Emotional Contagion and its Influence on Group Behavior.”</em> <strong>Administrative Science Quarterly, 47(4)</strong>, 644-675. – A seminal experiment in an organizational setting. Barsade placed participants in groups to complete a cooperative task (a management simulation) and secretly planted a confederate instructed to display either positive mood (cheerful, energetic) or neutral mood. The study found <strong>group emotional contagion</strong>: groups with the upbeat confederate caught that mood, which led to improved cooperation, less conflict, and higher perceived task performance. This paper is a classic proof that emotional states pass between people in real-time and significantly change collective outcomes – here, economic-like decisions in a group incentive structure. It helps distinguish contagion from framing because the confederate didn’t overtly persuade or change information, only their emotional demeanor; yet the group’s behavior changed. Barsade’s work is often cited in both management and behavioral econ literature as evidence that emotional contagion is a real factor in team and market dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hatfield, E., Cacioppo, J. T., &amp; Rapson, R. L. (1993).</strong> <em>“Emotional Contagion.”</em> <strong>Current Directions in Psychological Science, 2(3)</strong>, 96-100. – This is a short review piece (peer-reviewed) that introduced the term “emotional contagion” to a broad scientific audience. It summarizes underlying mechanisms – mimicry, feedback, and synchronization processes by which people tend to automatically align with others’ emotional expressions (e.g.&nbsp;unconsciously mirroring a smile or frown, leading to sharing the emotion). While not specific to economics, it provides foundational evidence (from experiments and everyday examples) that emotional contagion is a pervasive phenomenon. The authors discuss how contagion can influence group decision-making, noting for instance that in negotiations or businesses, one person’s emotions can set the tone for the whole interaction. Citing this is useful to ground the concept theoretically and to show that our project builds on established psychological mechanisms of emotion transmission.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coviello, L., et al.&nbsp;(2014).</strong> <em>“Detecting Emotional Contagion in Massive Social Networks.”</em> <strong>PLoS ONE, 9(3)</strong>: e90315. – This study complements Kramer et al.&nbsp;by using a <strong>natural experiment</strong> approach on social network data. The authors took billions of Facebook status updates and used rainfall as an instrumental variable for mood (rainy days tend to induce more negative affect locally). They found that when it rains in one city, not only do that city’s Facebook posts get slightly more negative, but friends <em>in other cities where it isn’t raining</em> also post more negative content – indicating emotional contagion at a distance. The paper estimates contagion effects size and rules out alternative explanations (friends aren’t just talking about the weather, etc.). This is a valuable real-world evidence that emotional states propagate through social ties and can affect behavior (posting behavior here is the outcome, but by extension, purchasing or voting behaviors might also shift with network mood). It solidifies the idea that emotional contagion is measurably present in large economic agents networks and thus relevant for phenomena like market sentiment or political waves.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dohmen, T., et al.&nbsp;(2006).</strong> <em>“Seemingly Irrelevant Factors in Economic Decision-Making: Evidence from the Weather.”</em> <strong>Economic Journal, 119</strong>(537), 153-166. – This paper analyzes how transient emotions induced by weather affect economic decisions, illustrating contagion-like mood carryovers. Using bank data and experiments, the authors show that on sunnier days people exhibit more optimism and risk-taking, whereas gloomy weather makes them risk-averse. While not an interpersonal contagion study, it’s key evidence that <em>incidental mood</em> (which can spread among people similarly exposed, like within a region) influences decisions such as investors’ willingness to take risks. It supports the broader point that external emotional influences (like environment or others’ mood) can causally impact economic behavior. By including it, we emphasize how even in the absence of explicit emotional communication, shared mood shifts (a form of collective emotion) change outcomes – bridging to the idea that emotional tone from others can do so as well. This study helps answer how we know it’s emotion causing the change: the authors isolate weather as an exogenous factor, analogous to isolating someone else’s emotional display as an exogenous factor on the recipient.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>3) Experimental Design Precedents</strong> – important studies that provide a template or precedent for our experimental design (crossing emotional tone with requests/messages):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Scharlemann, J. P., Eckel, C. C., Kacelnik, A., &amp; Wilson, R. (2001).</strong> <em>“The Value of a Smile: Game Theory with a Human Face.”</em> <strong>Journal of Economic Psychology, 22(5)</strong>, 617-640. – An inventive experiment in which players in a one-shot trust game saw a photo of their counterpart’s face before deciding how much to trust them. One key finding was that seeing a smiling partner significantly increased the amount sent (trust), whereas seeing a neutral or unsmiling face led to less trust. This is a direct manipulation of the counterpart’s <em>emotional expression</em> (tone) affecting an economic decision. The study is a precedent for our project as it isolates emotional tone (happy facial expression) while keeping the economic structure constant. It shows how to experimentally vary emotional cues (by preparing photos with different expressions) and measure the effect on behavior. The “value of a smile” study is often cited for quantifying how a simple emotional signal can alter outcomes in a game-theoretic context, thereby providing a model for designs where emotional tone is the independent variable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sinaceur, M. &amp; Tiedens, L. Z. (2006).</strong> <em>“Get Mad and Get More: The Influence of Expressing Anger on Outcomes in Negotiation.”</em> <strong>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 42(3)</strong>, 314-322. – This paper reported experiments where negotiators expressed either anger or no emotion during deal-making. Expressing anger led to the opponent offering larger concessions and more favorable final agreements to the angry party (provided the anger was viewed as credible and not overly destructive). It’s a clear demonstration that <strong>emotional tone can be manipulated (in this case, via scripted verbal expressions of anger) to causally affect economic outcomes in bargaining</strong>. As a design precedent, it used confederates or trained participants to inject emotion in a controlled way, and measured quantifiable outcomes (concession size). It also explored a boundary condition: if the power dynamic changed or anger was inappropriate, the effect diminished, which informs our project about when emotional tone works. This study is a template for crossing emotional expression with a negotiation context frame; it shows how to instruct participants to display a specific tone and the importance of maintaining realism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gerend, M. A. &amp; Maner, J. K. (2011).</strong> <em>“Fear, Anger, Fruits, and Veggies: Interactive Effects of Emotion and Message Framing on Health Behavior.”</em> <strong>Health Psychology, 30(4)</strong>, 420-423. – An experiment outside economics but highly relevant methodologically. Participants were induced into an emotional state (fear or anger) and then given either a gain-framed or loss-framed message encouraging fruit and vegetable consumption. The <strong>2x2 design</strong> revealed a crossover interaction: fear made the loss-framed message more persuasive, while anger made the gain-frame more persuasive. This study serves as a precedent by showing how to factorially manipulate emotion and message tone, which is analogous to manipulating the emotional tone of a request and the context framing. Its procedure – emotion induction via tasks, then exposure to framed appeal, then measuring behavior (self-reported diet choices over 2 weeks) – is a blueprint for our design. It underscores the need to consider interactions and demonstrates that <strong>emotions can moderate framing effects</strong>. For our project, it provides evidence on operationalization (simple writing prompts to induce anger vs.&nbsp;fear, standardized pamphlets for framing) and on the importance of matching emotional tone to message type for effectiveness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ferracci, S., et al.&nbsp;(2022).</strong> <em>“Shall I Show My Emotions? The Effects of Facial Expressions in the Ultimatum Game.”</em> <strong>Brain Sciences, 12(1)</strong>, 8. – A recent study that directly investigated emotional tone (via facial expressions) in an economic game. In one experiment, participants acted as responders seeing proposers’ faces showing happiness, neutrality, anger, or disgust; in another, participants were proposers seeing responders’ emotional reactions. The design is a precedent for embedding emotional tone in a classic economic paradigm. Results: responders’ decisions were mostly driven by offer fairness (only a small effect of proposer emotion), but <strong>proposers offered significantly more when facing a happy-looking responder and the least for an angry/disgusted responder</strong>. This indicates proposers anticipated rejection from negative-emotion responders and adjusted accordingly. Ferracci et al.&nbsp;exemplify how to <strong>operationalize emotional tone with visual stimuli</strong> (they used validated facial expression photos) and measure both first- and second-mover behavior changes. For our project, it’s a valuable template on incorporating emotional expressions into a controlled economic game and it highlights asymmetric effects (tone may matter more for one side’s decision). Being peer-reviewed and neuroscientifically oriented, it also suggests measuring neural/physiological responses, though the key takeaway for design is the use of images to convey tone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Zhou, M., Hu, Y., &amp; Wang, D. (2023).</strong> <em>“Trust or Distrust: The Effect of Facial Emotion and Trustworthy Behavior on Trust Decision-Making.”</em> <strong>Psychologica Belgica, 63(1)</strong>, 105-119. – Another recent experiment with a <strong>repeated trust game</strong>, where participants interacted with multiple counterpart “players” that differed in both past behavior (trustworthy vs.&nbsp;untrustworthy returns) and facial emotional expressions (happy vs.&nbsp;angry, and varying arousal levels). This study is a strong precedent because it crosses an emotional cue with a framing/context cue (the partner’s reputation). Key findings: investors sent more money to partners who not only had proven trustworthy but also <strong>displayed happy facial expressions</strong>, and they sent significantly less to partners showing angry expressions – even if those partners had a good track record. It also noted that when behavior and facial emotion were inconsistent, participants relied more on behavior than on facial tone. Zhou et al.&nbsp;showcase a design where emotional tone is operationalized via photos and varied within a subject across rounds. This allowed them to see how quickly participants update trust based on emotional signals. For our purposes, it’s a precedent in combining emotional tone with another important factor (collaborative vs.&nbsp;competitive behavior framing). It informs our design to consider dynamic settings and that emotional tone effects might diminish when objective behavior feedback is available. The paper provides methodological insight on using multiple stimulus persons and ensuring expressions are standardized. It’s also peer-reviewed, reinforcing the result that emotional tone (a simple smile or frown) can significantly sway economic decisions like trust, which is central to our project’s thesis.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>4) Emotion Measurement Methods</strong> – five key references on tools/methods to measure emotions in experiments, ensuring we can quantify participants’ emotional responses to treatments:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Mauss, I. B. &amp; Robinson, M. D. (2009).</strong> <em>“Measures of Emotion: A Review.”</em> <strong>Cognition and Emotion, 23(2)</strong>, 209-237. – A highly cited review article that evaluates different methods of measuring emotion (self-report, physiological indicators, facial behavior, etc.). It provides guidance on reliability, validity, and convergence of measures. For example, it notes that <strong>real-time self-reports of emotion tend to correlate well with facial and autonomic responses</strong>, supporting their use. It also discusses pitfalls (e.g.&nbsp;self-report bias, the need for immediate measurement before emotions dissipate). This is a key reference for justifying our measurement approach: if we use self-reported mood or discrete emotions post-stimulus, Mauss &amp; Robinson reassure that’s a valid approach. Likewise, if we include psychophysiology or coding of facial expressions, this review covers best practices and typical effect sizes. Overall, it ensures our methodology section stands on solid evidence about how to <em>capture</em> emotions in the lab.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kulke, L., Feyerabend, D., &amp; Schacht, A. (2020).</strong> <em>“A Comparison of the Affectiva iMotions Facial Expression Analysis Software with EMG for Identifying Facial Expressions of Emotion.”</em> <strong>Frontiers in Psychology, 11</strong>, 329. – This is a methodological study comparing an automated facial coding software (Affdex by Affectiva) against the gold-standard of facial EMG readings. They had participants make happy and angry facial expressions and measured both methods’ outputs. The results showed high correlation between software estimates and EMG, and both could correctly distinguish happy vs.&nbsp;angry expressions above chance. The software slightly outperformed EMG in not misclassifying neutral as negative as often. This paper is important for our project if we plan to use automated facial emotion tracking. It indicates that such tools are sufficiently accurate to trust in an experiment (with the benefit of being less invasive than attaching electrodes). We can cite this to justify using a webcam-based facial analysis to measure participants’ reactions, or to validate our emotional tone manipulations (e.g.&nbsp;confirming participants actually frowned more in the anger condition). It’s peer-reviewed and provides specifics on calibration and which emotion metrics are reliable, guiding our implementation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tausczik, Y. R. &amp; Pennebaker, J. W. (2010).</strong> <em>“The Psychological Meaning of Words: LIWC and Computerized Text Analysis Methods.”</em> <strong>Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 29(1)</strong>, 24-54. – This article introduces and validates the <strong>LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count)</strong> tool, one of the most widely used sentiment analysis dictionaries for text. It explains how word categories (positive emotion words, negative emotion words, anger words, etc.) are defined and how their frequencies in a text can serve as proxies for emotional tone. It also reviews studies that used LIWC to successfully predict outcomes (e.g.&nbsp;depressive symptom levels from diary entries, persuasiveness of speeches from emotional word use). For our project, if we intend to analyze the emotional tone of written or spoken content (like transcripts of requests or participants’ written responses), this is a key reference supporting the method. It assures that counting emotion-laden words is a validated measure of sentiment and can be done reliably with software. Also, if we plan to ensure our stimulus messages differ in emotional tone, LIWC can quantify that difference (e.g.&nbsp;the emotional version has, say, 5% of words in the sadness category vs.&nbsp;0% in the neutral version). Thus, Tausczik &amp; Pennebaker (2010) underpins any text-based sentiment analysis in our methodology, ensuring we have a scientific basis for claims about emotional tone in language.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gorodnichenko, Y., Pham, T., &amp; Talavera, O. (2021).</strong> <em>“Social Media, Sentiment and Public Opinions: Evidence from #Brexit and #USElection.”</em> (Published as NBER Working Paper No.&nbsp;24631; later in European Economic Review, 136). – (If focusing specifically on the Fed Chair tone study: Gorodnichenko, Pham, &amp; Talavera (2021) <em>“Media Sentiment and Central Bank Communication.”</em> NBER WP and Journal of Monetary Economics, forthcoming.) This entry represents <strong>voice and sentiment analysis in an economic context</strong>. The researchers used machine learning to analyze central bank speakers’ vocal tone for emotional cues and separated that from textual content. They found emotional cues in voice predicted market movements. We include this as a methodological reference showing how to quantify vocal emotional tone. It describes extracting acoustic features and using an algorithm to classify emotions (happy, sad, neutral, etc.), which is exactly the kind of method we might use if our experiment involves audio/video of requests. Moreover, it validates that such classified emotions correlate with meaningful outcomes (market index changes), supporting the sensitivity of the method. While this study is an application, from a methods standpoint it demonstrates state-of-the-art sentiment analysis beyond text – something we can leverage. It assures that capturing tone via technology (AI analysis of voice) is feasible and informative in economic research.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cowen, A. S. &amp; Keltner, D. (2017).</strong> <em>“Self-report Captures 27 Distinct Categories of Emotion Bridged by Continuous Gradients.”</em> <strong>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 114(38)</strong>, E7900-E7909. – This innovative study used a large sample to map out a rich emotional space based on self-report responses to video stimuli. Participants watched short emotionally evocative video clips and reported their feelings; analyses revealed 27 emotion categories (e.g.&nbsp;awe, empathy, nostalgia) rather than just the basic six, with smooth gradients between them. We cite this as a cutting-edge approach to <strong>measuring nuanced emotional responses</strong>. It shows that self-report, when done with fine granularity and sophisticated analysis, can differentiate subtle tones (which might be useful if our experiment expects complex emotions from participants, not just positive/negative). The study also produced an interactive map of emotion semantics. For our purposes, referencing Cowen &amp; Keltner can justify using more granular emotion scales or multiple adjectives to capture the richness of participants’ reactions to our stimuli. It also reminds us that emotional tone isn’t binary – there are multiple distinct emotions that could be relevant (e.g.&nbsp;anger vs.&nbsp;disgust both negative but with different effects). Methodologically, it encourages moving beyond a single “valence” measure to a profile of emotional response, if needed. This is useful if our design might induce, say, both anger and sadness and we want to tell them apart via measurement. In sum, it’s a peer-reviewed example of advanced self-report methodology revealing the breadth of emotional responses, informing how we might design our questionnaires or interpret results in a nuanced way.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>5) Real-World Applications</strong> – key articles showing how emotional tone/framing effects manifest in real-world economic behavior, underscoring the practical importance of the research:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Small, D. A., Loewenstein, G., &amp; Slovic, P. (2007).</strong> <em>“Sympathy and Callousness: The Impact of Deliberative Thought on Donations to Identifiable and Statistical Victims.”</em> <strong>Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 102(2)</strong>, 143-153. – This influential paper demonstrated the <em>identifiable victim effect</em> in charitable giving. In experiments and surveys, people gave significantly more to a single named suffering individual (with an emotionally compelling story) than to a statistical group of victims, even when logically the group donation would help more people. Furthermore, when participants were made to think analytically (deliberative thought), their donations to the identifiable victim dropped – suggesting that emotional gut reactions drive generosity, and too much thinking dampens it. This real-world implication is huge for fundraising campaigns: the emotional tone and personal appeal of a request can outweigh factual appeals. We include this as it directly shows how <strong>emotional tone of a request (heartfelt narrative) causally increases giving in practice</strong>, and quantifies the effect. It’s a peer-reviewed field/lab study spanning psychology and economics, providing external validity to our experimental focus. It underscores the importance of not just demonstrating effects in lab tasks but also understanding them in contexts like charity campaigns where policy and marketing strategies are developed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Brader, T. (2005).</strong> <em>“Striking a Responsive Chord: How Political Ads Motivate and Persuade Voters through Emotional Appeals.”</em> <strong>American Journal of Political Science, 49(2)</strong>, 388-405. – A widely cited study in political science analyzing campaign advertisements. Brader conducted experiments exposing participants to political ads that varied only in emotional content (music and imagery designed to evoke either enthusiasm or fear), while keeping the candidate’s message identical. He found that <strong>enthusiasm appeals</strong> (uplifting music, positive imagery) mobilized committed supporters – increasing their intention to vote – whereas <strong>fear appeals</strong> (ominous music, threat imagery) persuaded undecided voters by increasing information seeking and reducing reliance on party cues. This research is a real-world parallel to our interest: it shows emotional tone can be a strategic tool in influencing voter turnout and choices. The fact that enthusiastic vs.&nbsp;scary tone had different effects also informs our understanding of <em>which</em> emotion to use for what goal. As a peer-reviewed field experiment embedded in real campaign materials, it validates that the lab findings on emotional framing scale to large-scale behaviors like voting. Including Brader (2005) highlights the applicability of our research – emotional tone isn’t just a laboratory curiosity; it can swing elections (e.g.&nbsp;through turnout). It also gives us a concrete example of emotional framing in mass communication, relevant if our project extends to policy messaging or public appeals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gorodnichenko, Y., Pham, T., &amp; Talavera, O. (2021).</strong> <em>“The Voice of Monetary Policy: Emotional Tone and Market Reactions.”</em> <strong>NBER Working Paper No.&nbsp;29597 (published in 2022)</strong>. – This study analyzed <strong>Federal Reserve press conferences</strong> by applying voice emotion recognition to the Fed Chair’s spoken words. The authors found that when the Chair’s tone sounded more negative or worried (even if the policy content was unchanged), the stock market reacted with <em>significant declines</em>, and vice versa for a positive/upbeat tone. In fact, a shift from a positive to negative tone could move the S&amp;P 500 by as much as 200 basis points. Crucially, they controlled for the textual content of the statements, isolating tone as the driver. This is a compelling real-world example showing <strong>emotional tone can have concrete economic consequences</strong>: trillions in market value can hinge on the perceived sentiment of a central banker’s voice. We include it to emphasize the stakes of our research – understanding emotional tone isn’t only about lab games; it’s about financial markets, investment decisions, and perhaps broader economic expectations. It demonstrates that even highly sophisticated actors (investors) are influenced by emotional cues. For our project, it provides external validation and a source of inspiration for measuring tone quantitatively. It’s also a case where improving policy communication might require managing emotional tone, which is an angle we can mention as an implication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DellaVigna, S., List, J. A., &amp; Malmendier, U. (2012).</strong> <em>“Testing for Altruism and Social Pressure in Charitable Giving.”</em> <strong>Quarterly Journal of Economics, 127(1)</strong>, 1-56. – A field experiment sending fundraisers door-to-door to solicit donations, with some households randomly assigned to receive a flyer allowing them to opt out (“Do Not Disturb” to avoid the ask). The study found many people took the opt-out to avoid facing the solicitor, and overall giving dropped when opt-out was easy. The interpretation is that a significant portion of giving was driven by <strong>social pressure and empathy guilt</strong> – basically emotional discomfort of saying no face-to-face. This real-world evidence shows the power of in-person emotional appeals (and the aversion they can cause). We list this because it quantifies emotional factors in a market for charity: some people donate not because of pure altruism or information, but because the <em>emotional tone of a personal ask (the guilt/pity invoked)</em> compels them, and if given an escape, they avoid the emotional encounter to not feel bad. This informs our research on “responding to emotions” by illustrating that emotional tone has a <em>cost</em> or <em>benefit</em> that people anticipate. It’s a top-tier econ journal article, lending credibility that emotional effects in economic behavior are recognized at the highest level. It also underscores that emotional tone can have welfare implications (people might prefer to avoid it). This can enrich our discussion on ethical use of emotional appeals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fowler, J. H. &amp; Christakis, N. A. (2008).</strong> <em>“Dynamic Spread of Happiness in a Large Social Network.”</em> <strong>BMJ (British Medical Journal), 337</strong>, a2338. – A longitudinal analysis of 20 years of data from the Framingham Heart Study network, examining how happiness (measured by repeated surveys) spreads through social ties. They found that if someone becomes happier, their friend living nearby is 15% more likely to become happier, and the effect extends to friends of friends (up to three degrees, though diminishing). Notably, happiness spread <em>more through face-to-face contacts</em> than distant ones, suggesting the role of emotional communication in person. We include this as a real-world epidemiological study of emotional contagion with clear economic implications (happiness is linked to productivity, health behaviors, etc.). It provides evidence that positive emotional states can cascade in communities, which might translate to economic outcomes like consumption patterns or voting turnout (happy people might be more civic-minded, for instance). The BMJ study supports the idea that <strong>emotional climates</strong> can emerge, which our project on emotional tone of requests can tap into: a leader’s or marketer’s emotional tone could trigger broader shifts in group mood and subsequent behaviors. It’s a rigorous, peer-reviewed study using statistical network analysis, adding depth to our application examples – showing that beyond single interactions, <em>collective emotional dynamics</em> are at play in the real world. This justifies why understanding emotional tone effects is not only academically interesting but practically significant for predicting social and economic trends.</p></li>

<p>Each of these articles offers insights either into why emotional tone matters, how to study it in the lab, or what it means in real-world scenarios. Together, they would provide a solid foundation for an academic supervisor or funding proposal to see both the scholarly context and the practical stakes of the ‘Responding to Emotions’ project. The mix of recent (last ten years) and foundational studies ensures the review is up-to-date yet grounded in influential prior work.</p>
