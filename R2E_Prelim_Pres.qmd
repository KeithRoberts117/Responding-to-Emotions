## Introduction {.smaller}

- Economic choices can be shaped and manipulated by **messages** (policy advisories, charity appeals, public-health nudges)

- However, a message's content does not exist in a vacuum and is heavily influenced by the communicative **tone**
  - Tone can influence attention, trust, and/or willingness to pay/give

- Separating the *content* from its *tone* has so far been untenable
  - Not well understood whether the content or the tone matters more in communication

- Recent advances in generative AI and facereading technology allow us to causally test the impact of a message's tone vs its content on a decision maker's choice

## Quick Primer {.smaller .scrollable}

- **Emotional tone**: affective quality conveyed by a message (voice, facial expression, wording)
- **State affect** vs **trait affect**: momentary feelings vs stable dispositions
- **Emotional contagion**: unintentional convergence of audience affect toward the sender’s displayed affect


- **Arousal × Valence Circumplex** (Posner, J. etal., (2005)): 
  - Arousal = intensity of the emotion
  - Valence = positivity/negativity i.e. the direction

## Related and Motivating Literature {.scrollable}

1. Necessity of Emotion in Economics
  - *Simon, H. (1983)*: "...in order to have anything like a complete theory of human rationality, we have to understand what role emotion plays in it."
  - *Elster, J. (1998)*: Argues emotion is a necessity when studying economic choice
  - *Lerner, J. S., Li, Y., Valdesolo, P., & Kassam, K. S. (2015)*: Systematic review of judgment and choice research in psychology. Highlights the lagged pace under which economics models are only recently incorporating emotion. 
  
2. Emotional Contagion
  - *Barsade, S. G. (2002)*: Groups with an upbeat experimental partner "caught" their mood, which led to improved cooperation, less conflict, and higher perceived task performance
  - *Brader, T. (2005)*: Political ads varied only in emotional content (music and imagery designed to evoke either enthusiasm or fear), while keeping the candidate’s message identical -- enthusiasm appeals mobilize committed supporters; fear appeals improved information sourcing

  
3. Real World Consequences to Emotional Messaging
  - *Gorodnichenko, Y., Pham, T., & Talavera, O. (2021)*: Analyzes social media information diffusion via political twitter "bots". Enhanced polarization highlights need to further study information diffusion and sentiment pushed by "bot" (AI) content   
  - *Gorodnichenko, Y., Pham, T., & Talavera, O. (2021)*: Analyze Fed Reserve press conferences via voice-emotion recognition. Find stock prices react significantly with Chair's tone in both directions

## Research Goals and Questions

- Our Goal: Investigate whether emotionally charged communication causally impacts behaviour through conscious persuasion (information) or through emotional contagion

1. RQ1: What is the effect of the emotional contagion/emotional tone from a message?
2. RQ2: What is the degree of emotional contagion?
3. RQ3: Does positive/negative emotional tone in a persuasive message change charitable giving relative to a neutral tone?

## Contributions {.smaller}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Novel Methodology  

- Our goal is to investigate an agent's *response* to emotions rather than emotional decision making itself

- To induce emotion, we leverage generative AI video creation software (Sora and/or [Veo3](https://deepmind.google/models/veo/)) to produce extremely life-like videos of humanoid characters
  - Characters express specific emotional profiles
  - Enhanced reproducibility and standardized emotional profiles + message content  

- To analyse emotional response, we use Noldus FaceReader: an advanced real-time video analysis software which characterizes and measures unconscious physiological responses 


### FaceReader (FACS)

::: {.incremental}
- An advanced deep learning neural network for facial-emotion recognition
- Vetted in literature against human scoring of emotions 
  - Performs as well or better than human scoring in a systematic review of 64 studies (Landmann, E. (2023))

- Facial Action Coding System (FACS) (Ekman and Friesen (1978)) codes facial Action Units (AUs) -- smallest visible units of
muscular activity in the face
- AUs help classify six universal facial patterns for anger, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise, and happiness

## Tentative Design

- **Participants**: In person lab sample (McDSL) with possible online extension 
- **Randomization**: Assign to **Neutral**, **Positive**, or **Negative** tone video (same script; different delivery/visual affect)  
- **Task**: Participant views AI video then makes a **donation** (or allocation) decision; repeated over rounds
  - Distraction task on certain round intervals?
  
- **Measures**: continuous emotional response recordings from FaceReader; post-video self-reports; baseline covariates


---

## Treatments {.smaller} 

| Arm | Script | Delivery (prosody) | Visual affect | Length |
|-----|--------|---------------------|---------------|--------|
| Neutral | Fixed | Flat/neutral | Neutral face/visuals | ~45s | 
| Positive | Fixed | Warm/enthusiastic | Positive valence cues | ~45s |
| Negative | Fixed | Somber/urgent | Negative valence cues | ~45s |


- Between group comparison; data is split into three arms listed in table 
- Each individual has some emotional reaction to the cue, which is a function of valence and arousal

---

## Key Variables 
- Data is a tuple $(d,a,v,X; e)$ of: 
  - donation $d$ 
  - arousal $a$ 
  - valence $v$ 
  - covariates/demographic factors $X$ 
  - emotional tone $e$ will be a controlled parameter

- Emotional Response to the message: $R_e = f(a, v)$
---

## Modelling {.smaller}

1. Estimate a linear model for each group to recover coefficients on valence, arousal, and the treatment (tone of message)

2. Estimate a pooled model with interactions of group identifiers and above variables to compare coefficients 

3. Estimate an ordered logit model to recover CDF of donations conditional on variables

  - Compare average marginal effects on donations given changes in individual dependent variables holding others fixed 

--- 


## Hypotheses (Directional)

- **H1**: positive tone increases giving vs. neutral  
- **H2**: negative tone reduces giving vs neutral
- **H3**: Effects **increase with induced valence/arousal**

## Expected Payoffs

- How do the two induced channels (tone and content) seperately influence the donation outcome
- If tone causally shifts giving, we learn **how to communicate** for policy, science, and fundraising  
- Mechanism evidence can inform **when** tone works (arousal vs valence; audience traits)  
- Even nulls are informative for **designing messages** and **guarding against over-claiming**
